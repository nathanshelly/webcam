# Webcam

*Built by Jacob Bruce and Nathan Shelly*

## Description

This project aims to walk through the steps of designing and building a webcam from scratch. We'll walk through PCB (printed circuit board) design, soldering of components, 3D printing of the outer enclosure, MCU code and website code to enable you to make your own webcam, or modify our design however you'd like! This repository acts as the landng page to various parts of the project. Here we'll have various files such as our PCB designs and a bill of materials.
